# giffel

Giffel delivers fresh perfectly looping .gifs, right in your browser. [Live demo right here!](http://mike.fi/giffel)

It fetches the most recent entries from [/r/perfectloops](https://www.reddit.com/r/perfectloops) and starts looping them. *Might transfer big loads of data!*

## Usage

Navigate to http://mike.fi/giffel with a modern browser. Chrome and Firefox should both work, IE/Edge I haven't tested yet.

The best thing you can do is to make it your screen saver. In OS X you can use [WebView screen saver](https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver).

## FAQ

### What's the name about?

Giffel means "Croissant" in Swedish.

### How did you come up with the idea?

I first created [sideshow](https://github.com/mieky/sideshow) for dashboard purposes. I soon realized I wanted to have cool animated GIFs as my screen saver, so I made this dedicated tool for that purpose alone.
